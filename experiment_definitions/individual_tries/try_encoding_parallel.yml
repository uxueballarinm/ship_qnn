- maxiter: 3000 # --- 1. Reduce Complexity here ---
  window_size: 3       # Reduced from 5. (Huge speedup: 2^3 vs 2^5 state space)
  select_features:        # Remove redundant features
  - wv                    # Surge
  - sv                    # Sway
  - yr                    # Yaw Rate
  - ya                    # Yaw Angle
  - rarad                 # Rudder (Control is crucial)
  # Removed 'vu' (Speed U) because it is redundant (calculated from wv and sv)

  # --- 2. Increase Power here (using the saved time) ---
  reps: 3                # Increased from 1. (Crucial for non-linear dynamics)
  encoding: 'parallel'     # Keep compact (fastest)
  ansatz: 'efficientsu2'  # Keep this (good expressivity)
  entangle: 'circular'    # Slightly better connectivity than reverse_linear

  # --- 3. Training Settings ---
  predict: 'motion'       # Good choice for low-reps (smoother target)
  optimizer: 'cobyla'
